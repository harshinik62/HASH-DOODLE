# HASH-DOODLE

This paint application is implemented using Java Swings. The database stores the login details of the user. A new user will not be allowed to login and use this application. An existing user can login with the username and password which will allow him to input the width and height of the canvas for the paint application. This will further allow the user to draw or colour.

This paint application will: 
1. Allow us to set the canvas size for the paint screen. 
2. Have a few quick colour selection buttons to choose from. 
3. Be able to draw strokes with the pencil tool and set thickness. 
4. Have a Colour Picker to choose from a vast variety of colours. 
5. Use the Load button to load or import images from the system.
